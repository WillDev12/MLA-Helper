# Why MLA Helper is useful

It saves time[^1]

It is easy to use[^2]

It it easy to install[^3]

[^1]: MLA helper was made to save time.  The easy to use GUI makes writing a whole lot easier when it comes to things such as quoting, citing, and a few others which makes the process a whole lot simpler.

[^2]: When creating MLA helper, I decided to make the most foolproof GUI possible so that anyone would be able to use it problem free.  Because of this, it is very organised and gets the job done for those who are not tech handy.

[^3]: Installing the program is easy and can be done in no time.  Please see [Installation](https://github.com/WillDev12/MLA-Helper/blob/main/readme.md#installation) for firther details or click [here](https://direct-link.net/378237/mla-helper) for a pre-made template (ad link)
